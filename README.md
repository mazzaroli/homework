## Integrating MyBatis DAOs and Switching Service Classes

This homework task focuses on enhancing the existing hierarchy by integrating MyBatis Data Access Objects (DAOs) while fulfilling the same requirements. Additionally, it involves transitioning service classes to leverage MyBatis.

### Task Overview

1. **MyBatis DAOs Integration**: Add MyBatis DAOs to the existing hierarchy, adhering to the same functionality and specifications as previously defined with JDBC-based DAOs.
2. **Mapping Strategy Choice**: Choose between XML or interface-based mapping for MyBatis configurations, ensuring seamless integration with the hierarchy.
3. **Service Classes Transition**: Switch service classes from the previously used approach (e.g., JDBC) to utilize MyBatis, maintaining the same functionality and flexibility.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **MyBatis DAO Integration**: Implement DAOs using MyBatis, adhering to the same CRUD operations and interfaces/abstract classes as previously defined.
2. **Mapping Configuration**: Choose an appropriate mapping strategy (XML or interface-based) for MyBatis configurations to ensure compatibility and efficiency.
3. **Service Layer Transition**: Modify service classes to leverage MyBatis for data access, ensuring the same functionality and flexibility as before.
